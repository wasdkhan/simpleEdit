1) What written language is the most complicated in the world? (Hint: It
uses four character sets.) (Is this question too easy?)  >> Japanese

2) What language has a vocabulary primarily of Arabic origin (about 70%,
I'm told), but uses the Roman alphabet? (I'd like to know where you found
the answer!)  >> Maltese

3) What non-Romance language uses a tilde (~) over the letter N? >> Estonian

4) What is the origin of the ampersand symbol? >> Derived from a stylized
    Latin "ET". The "E" looks like a backward "3", and the "T" is much
lower than the "E". ("Et" is "and" in Latin.)

5) What is an octothorpe? >>> An obscure term for the "#" symbol
